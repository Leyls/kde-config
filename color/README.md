Here we can say, so many colors, 256 x 256 x 256, could be divided into three kinds:
* Green, Blue, Purple
* Red, Yellow
* Black, Grey, White
I often name these three kinds as cold, warm and prosaic. Personally I prefer cold. I used a lot like dodger blue, royal blue, and tormotoise. But if you wanna a neutral feeling, use some red and yellow too. Warm color can make editting process enthusiastic.
